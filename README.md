# Elnitsky-Tilings-Mathematica

The notebook provides the base code for producing diagrams related to Elnitsky's tilings (see his thesis, titled RHOMBIC TILINGS OF POLYGONS AND CLASSES OF REDUCED WORDS IN COXETER GROUPS). The research this code was originally used for was done in direct collaboration with Prof Peter Rowley of the University of Manchester.

The codebook was written on Mathematica 13.0. 

Information on how to run the examples is included at the start of the notebook; the examples are designed to be editable to someone with minimal experience in Mathematica.
